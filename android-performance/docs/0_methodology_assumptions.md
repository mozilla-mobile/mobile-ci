# Introduction

In the ever-evolving landscape of web and mobile applications, browser
performance plays a pivotal role in shaping user experiences and determining the
success of digital products. Efficiently measuring and analyzing browser
performance metrics is essential for developers and performance engineers to
identify bottlenecks, optimize resource loading, and ensure seamless
interactions for end-users.

## Project Overview

The **Browser Performance Testing and Analysis** project is dedicated to
establishing a robust framework for accurately capturing and isolating browser
performance metrics. Traditional methodologies, such as those leveraging
Appium's typical client/server HTTP connections, often introduce measurement
inaccuracies due to the inherent overhead and potential interference with
network events. These inaccuracies can obscure the true performance
characteristics of both network and Document Object Model (DOM) activities
within browsers.

To address these challenges, our project adopts a methodology of utilizing
WebSocket connections in conjunction with the Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP).
This strategy aims to bypass the limitations of HTTP-based measurements,
enabling the collection of more precise and reliable performance data. By
directly interfacing with the browser through WebSockets, we can capture
granular network and DOM events without the distortion introduced by
intermediary layers.

## Objectives and Goals

The primary objectives of this project are:

1.  **Accurate Event Measurement:**

- **Network Events:** Capture detailed metrics related to DNS lookups, TCP
  handshakes, SSL negotiations, and content downloads.

- **DOM Events:** Isolate and measure DOM parsing, rendering times, and browser
  processing tasks independently from network influences.

2.  **Methodological Accuracy:**

- Utilize WebSocket connections to interact with browsers, ensuring that
  performance measurements are not adversely affected by the testing tools
  themselves.

- Avoid tightly coupled testing solutions that require instrumented builds,
  thereby maintaining flexibility and scalability across different applications
  and build types.

3.  **Data Consistency and Normalization:**

- Implement a standardized methodology that can be applied uniformly across
  various applications, including third-party and competitor apps.

- Ensure that performance data is comparable and reliable, facilitating
  meaningful cross-application analyses.

4.  **Insightful Analysis and Visualization:**

- Develop comprehensive visualization tools, including both static and
  interactive heatmaps, to analyze correlations between network and DOM metrics.

- Validate the effectiveness of our isolation techniques by demonstrating
  minimal or zero correlation between network and DOM activities, thereby
  confirming the accuracy of our measurements.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Using ChromeDevToolsProtocol vs. Webdriver BiDi

The use of the **Webdriver BiDi** is the preferred approach for this project;
however, the Python language bindings for Webdriver BiDi are incomplete,
somewhat limited, and not on the roadmap to be completed anytime soon, which
severely limits our access to the browser performance, network, and DOM events
via this standardized Websocket-based approach.

As a result, we can still use the same technical approach, but it will be using
CDP, which currently has the drawback of potentially changing for each browser
version released - requiring more vigilance in tracking and maintaining CDP API
versions for the browser under test.

While this does incur a maintanence cost, this enables us to get the performance
metrics we need without being entirely blocked from creating an accurate and
reliable solution.

### Isolating Network and DOM Activities

One of the core challenges in browser performance testing is accurately
isolating network activities from DOM processing to obtain true measurements of
each. Network events inherently influence the performance of DOM events, making
it difficult to discern their individual contributions. Our solution involves:

- **Subtraction Methodology:** By meticulously capturing network event timings
  and subtracting these from the corresponding DOM event timings, we aim to
  isolate the pure performance metrics of DOM activities.

- **WebSocket Integration:** Utilizing WebSockets to establish a direct and
  low-overhead connection with the browser ensures that the measurement process
  itself does not introduce significant delays or distortions.

### Avoiding Instrumented Testing Approaches

Instrumented testing tools like Espresso, while powerful, are tightly coupled
with the application's build process. This tight coupling can limit the
flexibility and scalability of performance testing across different applications
and build types. To overcome this, our approach:

- **Build Artifact Agnosticism:** Develop a testing framework that operates
  independently of the application's build process, allowing us to test any
  build variant---be it debug, beta, or production---without necessitating
  instrumented builds.

- **Consistency Across Applications:** Enable the testing of both proprietary
  and third-party applications using the same methodology, ensuring that
  performance data is normalized and comparable across different apps.

methodologically sound approach that leverages WebSocket connections and the
Chrome DevTools Protocol, this project strives to overcome the limitations of
traditional measurement methods. Through meticulous data collection, isolation
of network and DOM activities, and insightful data visualization, we aim to
provide actionable insights that drive performance optimizations and enhance
user experiences.

As we continue to refine our methodologies and address existing challenges, we hope this
framework will serve as a foundational tool for performance engineers and
developers seeking to achieve excellence in browser performance.

# Methodology for Browser Event Measurement

Accurate measurement of browser performance metrics is foundational to
understanding and optimizing user experiences in web and mobile applications.
This section delves into the methodology employed for capturing and isolating
browser events, highlighting the challenges with traditional measurement methods
and presenting a refined approach using WebSocket connections. By meticulously
defining captured events and elucidating the data collection and isolation
processes, we aim to ensure the precision and reliability of our performance
metrics.

## Detailed Exploration of the Challenges with Traditional Measurement Methods

### Limitations of Appium's Client/Server HTTP Connections

Appium has long been a staple in mobile application testing, offering robust
tools for automating interactions with mobile devices. However, when it comes to
capturing browser performance metrics, especially those related to network and
Document Object Model (DOM) events, relying solely on Appium's typical
client/server HTTP connections introduces several challenges:

1.  **Measurement Overhead:**

- **Latency Introduction:** The HTTP-based communication between the Appium
  server and the client introduces additional latency. This latency can skew
  timing measurements, making it difficult to discern the true performance
  characteristics of the browser.

- **Asynchronous Delays:** HTTP requests are inherently asynchronous. This
  asynchronicity can lead to delays in capturing real-time events, resulting in
  incomplete or fragmented data.

2.  **Interference with Network Events:**

- **HTTP Traffic Collision:** Since Appium communicates over HTTP, it can
  interfere with the very network events it aims to measure. For instance,
  capturing DNS lookups or TCP handshakes becomes unreliable as Appium's traffic
  may be conflated with the browser's network activities.

- **Resource Contention:** Simultaneous HTTP traffic from Appium and the browser
  can lead to resource contention, where both processes compete for network
  bandwidth and system resources, further distorting performance metrics.

3.  **Limited Granularity:**

- **Broad Event Categories:** Appium's HTTP connections provide high-level event
  categories without the granularity needed for in-depth performance analysis.
  Detailed metrics, such as specific timings for DNS resolution or SSL
  negotiations, are often inaccessible or imprecise.

- **Inadequate Event Sequencing:** The sequence and precise timing of DOM events
  relative to network events are challenging to capture accurately, hindering
  the ability to isolate and analyze these events effectively.

4.  **Reliability Concerns:**

- **Inconsistent Data Capture:** Variability in network conditions and Appium's
  own communication overhead can lead to inconsistent data capture, making it
  difficult to establish reliable performance baselines.

- **Potential Data Loss:** High traffic volumes or network instability can
  result in data loss or incomplete event logging, compromising the integrity of
  performance analyses.

### The Need for Methodological Exactness and Verification for Event Measurement

Given these challenges, there is a pressing need for a methodologically
pristine approach to capturing browser performance metrics. Pristine, in this context,
refers to the isolation of measurement processes from the very activities being
measured, ensuring that the act of measurement does not interfere with or
distort the data being collected. Achieving this is essential for:

- **Accurate Performance Insights:** Reliable data is paramount for identifying
  true performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization.

- **Consistent Benchmarking:** Establishing consistent and comparable
  performance benchmarks across different applications and environments.

- **Scalability and Flexibility:** Developing a testing framework that can adapt
  to various applications, build types, and testing scenarios without being
  constrained by inherent measurement limitations.

## Introduction of the WebSocket-Based Approach and Its Advantages

### Leveraging WebSockets for Direct Browser Interaction

To overcome the limitations posed by traditional HTTP-based measurement methods,
our project adopts a WebSocket-based approach in conjunction with the Chrome
DevTools Protocol (CDP). This strategy facilitates a direct and low-overhead
connection between our testing framework and the browser, enabling precise and
unobtrusive capture of performance events.

### Technical Details of WebSocket Connections

1.  **Protocol Fundamentals:**

- **WebSocket Overview:** WebSockets provide a full-duplex communication channel
  over a single, long-lived connection. Unlike HTTP, which follows a
  request-response pattern, WebSockets allow continuous data exchange between
  the client and server.

- **Handshake Process:** Establishing a WebSocket connection begins with an HTTP
  handshake where the client sends an `Upgrade` request to the server,
  indicating the desire to switch protocols. Upon acceptance, the connection
  transitions from HTTP to the WebSocket protocol.

2.  **Integration with Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP):**

- **CDP Overview:** CDP is a set of APIs that allow for tools to instrument,
  inspect, debug, and profile Chromium-based browsers. By interfacing with CDP,
  we can access detailed browser internals, including network and DOM events.

- **Event Subscription:** Through the WebSocket connection, we subscribe to
  specific CDP events related to network activities (e.g.,
  `Network.requestWillBeSent`, `Network.responseReceived`) and DOM events (e.g.,
  `DOM.contentEventFired`, `Page.loadEventFired`).

3.  **Advantages of WebSocket-Based CDP Integration:**

- **Reduced Overhead:** WebSocket's persistent connection minimizes the latency
  introduced by establishing multiple HTTP requests, ensuring that event timings
  are captured more accurately.

- **Real-Time Data Capture:** The full-duplex nature allows for real-time event
  monitoring, facilitating immediate and continuous data collection without
  interruption.

- **Granular Event Access:** CDP provides access to a comprehensive set of
  browser events with high temporal precision, enabling detailed performance
  analyses.

### Benefits of the WebSocket Approach

1.  **Enhanced Measurement Accuracy:**

- By eliminating the intermediary HTTP layer, we reduce potential sources of
  latency and interference, resulting in more accurate timing measurements.

2.  **Comprehensive Event Coverage:**

- The WebSocket-CDP integration allows for the capture of a wide array of
  network and DOM events with high granularity, enabling thorough performance
  assessments.

3.  **Scalability and Flexibility:**

- This approach is agnostic to the application being tested, allowing for the
  measurement of both proprietary and third-party applications without requiring
  instrumented builds.

4.  **Minimal Intrusion:**

- The direct connection ensures that the measurement process does not
  significantly interfere with the browser's operations, preserving the
  integrity of the captured data.

## Comprehensive Definitions of Captured Network and DOM Events

## Explanation of the Data Collection and Isolation Methodologies

### Data Collection Process

Our data collection methodology revolves around establishing a direct WebSocket
connection to the browser using the Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP). This
connection enables the real-time capture of detailed network and DOM events
without the interference inherent in traditional HTTP-based measurement methods.

1.  **Establishing the WebSocket Connection:**

- Initiate a WebSocket connection from the testing framework (running on a
  Macbook) to the browser instance on the connected Android device.

- Authenticate and configure the connection to ensure secure and stable
  communication channels.

2.  **Subscribing to Relevant CDP Events:**

- Utilize CDP to subscribe to specific network and DOM events that are critical
  for performance measurement.

- Ensure comprehensive coverage by subscribing to all necessary event streams,
  capturing the full lifecycle of network requests and DOM processing.

3.  **Real-Time Event Logging:**

- Implement listeners for each subscribed event, logging the precise timing and
  relevant data points.

- Aggregate and timestamp events to facilitate accurate correlation and
  subsequent analysis.

4.  **Data Storage and Processing:**

- Store captured events in structured data formats (e.g., CSV, JSON) for ease of
  analysis.

- Implement data validation and cleaning processes to ensure data integrity,
  including handling missing or anomalous values through median imputation.

### Isolation Methodology: Subtracting Network Event Timings from DOM Events

The core objective of our isolation methodology is to discern the true
performance characteristics of DOM activities by eliminating the confounding
influences of network events. This is achieved through a systematic subtraction
of network event timings from corresponding DOM event durations.

1.  **Identifying Overlapping Events:**

- Map each DOM event to its relevant network events based on their temporal
  sequence and functional dependencies.

- For instance, `adjusted_dom_parsing_time_ms` is derived by subtracting
  `dns_lookup_time_ms`, `tcp_handshake_time_ms`, `ssl_time_ms`, and `ttfb_ms`
  from the total DOM parsing time.

2.  **Performing the Subtraction:**

- Utilize calculated network event metrics to adjust the raw DOM event timings.

- Ensure that the subtraction accounts for all relevant network activities that
  directly impact the DOM processes being measured.

3.  **Ensuring Metric Accuracy:**

- Validate the adjusted metrics through correlation analyses, ensuring minimal
  or zero correlation between isolated network and DOM metrics.

- Continuously refine the subtraction logic to address any residual overlaps or
  measurement discrepancies.

### Reasoning Behind the Calculation Methodologies

1.  **Eliminating Measurement Bias:**

- By isolating DOM event timings from network activities, we eliminate the
  measurement bias introduced by network-induced latencies, leading to more
  accurate representations of browser performance.

2.  **Enhancing Data Reliability:**

- Subtracting network event timings ensures that the DOM metrics reflect only
  the browser's internal processing efficiencies, devoid of external network
  influences. This enhances the reliability of the data for performance
  optimization purposes.

3.  **Facilitating Comparative Analyses:**

- With isolated metrics, it becomes feasible to conduct meaningful comparative
  analyses across different browsers, applications, and testing environments, as
  the data is standardized and free from extraneous network-related variances.

4.  **Supporting Targeted Optimizations:**

- Understanding the pure DOM processing times allows developers and performance
  engineers to identify and target specific areas within the browser's rendering
  and processing pipelines for optimization, without being misled by
  network-related artifacts.

**Browser Performance Testing and Analysis** project. By transforming raw
performance metrics into meaningful visual representations, we can uncover
patterns, validate our measurement methodologies, and identify actionable
opportunities for optimization. This section outlines the various visualization
techniques employed, the rationale behind their selection, and the insights and
outcomes we aim to achieve through these analyses.
